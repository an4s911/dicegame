            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <p>Welcome to DiceGame, a thrilling game of chance and strategy played between you and the computer!</p>

            <h3>Rules for Your Turn:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>You have two dice to roll, and the sum of both dice is added to your current turn score.</li>
                <li>End your turn in one of three ways: turn over your dice to add your current turn score to your total
                    score, roll a single 1 to reset your current turn score to 0, or roll two 1's to reset your total
                    score to 0 and end your turn.</li>
                <li>
                    Alternatively, win the game by reaching a score of 100 or above. If the total score reaches 100 or
                    more
                    during your turn, the game ends immediately, even if your current turn is not completed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once your turn ends without you winning, it's the computer's turn.</p>

            <h3>Rules for the Computer's Turn:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The computer rolls the dice automatically and follows the same rules as you.</li>
                <li>If the computer rolls a 1, its current turn score resets to 0, just like yours. If the computer
                    rolls two 1's, its total score resets to 0, and its turn ends.</li>
                <li>The computer has a strategic advantage: if it reaches a current turn score of 20 or more, it turns
                    over its dice, adding the turn score to its total score, and then continues its turn.</li>
                <li>The game ends immediately if the computer's total score reaches 100 or more, and the computer
                    emerges as the winner.
                </li>
            </ul>
